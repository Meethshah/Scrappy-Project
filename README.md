Hello everyone!

I'm thrilled to be part of the Scrappy Project cohort. My name is Meeth Kumar Shah, and I'm currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. Known for my problem-solving skills and coding abilities, I thrive on challenges that push me to think creatively and innovatively.

Beyond academics, I enjoy building networks and gaining insights from diverse perspectives. Sports, particularly cricket, are a passion of mine, and I'm a die-hard fan of Dhoni, whom I see as an inspiration for his self-belief and determination.

As a tech enthusiast, I'm fascinated by emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, AI, and Gen AI. I actively participate in tech events and conduct research to stay updated on the latest advancements in the field.
